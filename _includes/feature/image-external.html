    Image include for a non-collection item.
    This include adds an image in a figure to the page styled using bootstrap, https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/content/figures/
    If you want to use an image from your collection, please use "feature/image.html" instead! 

    It requires a URL or relative path to the image.

    E.G. --> {% include feature/image-external.html src="/assets/img/demo_001.png" alt="example image" %}

    Options: 
    - "src" = a URL or relative paths to an image file. e.g. "https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/images/palouse_sm.jpg" . To include an image that is part of this project, a relative path can be used, e.g. "/assets/img/collectionbuilder-logo.png". (required)
    - "alt" = alternative text describing the image. This is a required accessibility feature. (required)
    - "width" = will use responsive sizing to set the % size on desktop (will be 100% on mobile), choose from "25", "50", "75", or "100" (optional)
    - "caption" = by default there is no caption. The caption option allows you to manually add a text caption. (optional)
    - "float" = will use responsive float utility to add float on desktop (will not float on mobile), choose from "left" or "right" (optional, not recommended)
