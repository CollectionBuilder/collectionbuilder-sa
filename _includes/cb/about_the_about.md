## About the About Page

We want to make About pages exciting, and easy to build. 

The CollectionBuilder about page features a narrowed column with its own (optional) menu, featured content, and some technical information. 

To build one, a user writes in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and includes  content from the site, as well as typical [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) features like cards and modals, using code snippets like those detailed below. 
We hope this makes it easier for site builders to develop the collection AND add interesting and engaging contextual information. 

(Each included file has several options, which are documented in the files themselves. I've given the content widths of 25% and 50% to save space, but you can feature the entire image or document.)
